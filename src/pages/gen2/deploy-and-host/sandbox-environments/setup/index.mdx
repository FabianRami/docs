Amplify gives every developer a personal cloud sandbox environment that provides isolated development spaces for developers to rapidly build, test, and iterate on their fullstack app. Each developer gets their own disposable sandbox environment connected to cloud resources.

## Creating a new sandbox environment

Before you begin, you will need to:

- Follow the [getting started](../../../start/getting-started/) instructions
- Ensure `@aws-amplify/backend-cli` is in your `package.json > devDependencies`. If not, run `npm install @aws-amplify/backend-cli`
- Configure your local machine to be able to deploy to AWS

Open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
cd myapp
npx amplify sandbox
```

When you deploy a cloud sandbox, Amplify creates an AWS CloudFormation stack `amplify-{appName}-{$whoami}-sandbox` in your AWS account with the resources configured in your `amplify` folder.

After the successful deployment of the CloudFormation stack, the sandbox tracks and monitors for file changes in your backend and performs real-time updates to the CloudFormation stack. This functionality is built leveraging the hotswap capability of the AWS CDK.

## Terminating a sandbox environment

After testing all the changes associated to the backend, you can terminate the sandbox session via `Ctrl+C` and can then choose whether you want to keep or delete all the resources in the sandbox environment.

## Manage sandbox environments

You can view and manage all the sandbox environments for your team in the new [Amplify console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/apps/sandboxes).

## Best Practices

Best practices to keep in mind when working with cloud sandbox environments:

- Sandboxes are identical in fidelity to your production environments.
- Code changes are continuously deployed to your sandbox on every save for fast iterations.
- Use sandboxes for experimentation and testing, not production workloads.
- Deploy one sandbox per Amplify app to prevent conflicts.
- Reset sandboxes occasionally to clear out unused resources and save costs
