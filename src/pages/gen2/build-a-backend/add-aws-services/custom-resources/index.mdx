Amplify Gen2 provides the ability to add custom AWS resources with the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).  The CDK is an open source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages, such as Typescript.

CDK extends Amplify by making it easy to add custom resources and configurations beyond what Amplify supports out of the box. For example, a developer could use CDK to hook up a Redis cache, add a Lambda function that runs on a schedule, or implement custom security rules.

The infrastructure defined via CDK code is deployed along with the Amplify project. This gives developers the simplicity of Amplify, combined with the flexibility of CDK for situations where they need more customization.

AWS CDK apps are composed of building blocks known as [Constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html), which are composed together to form [stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.Stack.html) and [apps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.App.html). You can learn more in the [Concepts - AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/core_concepts.html) documentation.
</Callout>

With the Amplify Code-first DX, you have the option to create individual [Constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html) and [Stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/stacks.html) which will be composed into the [Backend](https://next-docs.amplify.aws/gen2/how-amplify-works/concepts/#backend) for your project.

## Defining a CDK Construct


<Callout>
Constructs are the basic building blocks of AWS CDK apps. A construct represents a "cloud component" and encapsulates everything AWS CloudFormation needs to create the component. [Read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html)
</Callout>


Custom constructs allow you to encapsulate common patterns into reusable components. This helps you implement best practices, accelerate development, and maintain consistency across applications.

A common use case is creating a custom notification construct that combines a Lambda functions with SNS and SES.

This AWS CDK construct implements a decoupled notification system using Amazon SNS and Lambda. It allows publishing notification messages to an SNS topic from one Lambda function, and processing those messages asynchronously using a separate Lambda subscribed to the topic.

The key components are:

- An Amazon SNS topic to receive notification messages
- A Lambda function to publish messages to the SNS topic
- A second Lambda subscribed to the topic that processes the messages and sends emails via Amazon SES

The publisher Lambda allows publishing a message containing the email subject, body text, and recipient address. The emailer Lambda retrieves messages from the SNS topic and handles sending the actual emails.

The `CustomNotifications` custom CDK construct can be defined as follows:

```ts title="amplify/custom/CustomNotifications/resource.ts"
import { Runtime } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";
import {
  NodejsFunction,
  NodejsFunctionProps,
} from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs";
import * as sns from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-sns";
import * as subs from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-sns-subscriptions";
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { dirname, join } from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);

export type Message = {
  subject: string;
  body: string;
  recipient: string;
};
interface CustomNotificationsProps {
  sourceAddress: string;
}

export class CustomNotifications extends Construct {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: CustomNotificationsProps) {
    super(scope, id);

    const { sourceAddress } = props;

    // Create SNS topic
    const topic = new sns.Topic(this, "NotificationTopic");

    const nodeJsFunctionProps: NodejsFunctionProps = {
      bundling: {
        externalModules: [
          "@aws-sdk", // Use the '@aws-sdk' available in the Lambda runtime
        ],
      },
      runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
      handler: "index.handler",
    };

    // Lambda to publish messages
    const publisher = new NodejsFunction(this, "Publisher", {
      entry: join(__dirname, "publisher.ts"),
      environment: {
        topicArn: topic.topicArn,
      },
      ...nodeJsFunctionProps,
    });

    // Lambda to process messages
    const emailer = new NodejsFunction(this, "Emailer", {
      entry: join(__dirname, "emailer.ts"),
      environment: {
        sourceAddress,
      },
      ...nodeJsFunctionProps,
    });

    // Subscribe emailer lambda to SNS topic
    topic.addSubscription(new subs.LambdaSubscription(emailer));

    // Allow publisher to publish to SNS topic
    topic.grantPublish(publisher);
  }
}
```

The Lambda function code for the `Publisher` is:

```ts title="amplify/custom/CustomNotifications/publisher.ts"
// publisher Lambda
import { PublishCommand, SNSClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-sns";

const client = new SNSClient({ region: process.env.AWS_REGION });

export const handler = async (event: any) => {
  try {
    const { subject, body, recipient } = event;

    const params = {
      TopicArn: process.env.topicArn,
      Message: JSON.stringify({
        subject,
        body,
        recipient,
      }),
    };

    const command = new PublishCommand(params);
    await client.send(command);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    throw err;
  }
};
```

The Lambda function code for the `Emailer` is:

```ts title="amplify/custom/CustomNotifications/emailer.ts"
// emailer Lambda
import { SESClient, SendEmailCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ses";
import { DeleteMessageCommand, SNSClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-sns";
import type { SNSEvent } from "aws-lambda";
import { Message } from "./resource";

const sesClient = new SESClient({ region: process.env.AWS_REGION });
const snsClient = new SNSClient({ region: process.env.AWS_REGION });

export const handler = async (event: SNSEvent) => {
  for (const record of event.Records) {
    const message = JSON.parse(record.Sns.Message);

    await sendEmail(message);

    await deleteMsg(record.Sns.ReceiptHandle, record.Sns.TopicArn);
  }
};

const sendEmail = async (msg: Message) => {
  const { recipient, subject, body } = msg;

  const params = {
    Source: process.env.sourceAddress,
    Destination: {
      ToAddresses: [recipient],
    },
    Message: {
      Body: {
        Text: { Data: body },
      },
      Subject: { Data: subject },
    },
  };

  try {
    const command = new SendEmailCommand(params);
    const result = await sesClient.send(command);
    console.log(`Email sent to ${recipient}: ${result.MessageId}`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error sending email to ${recipient}: ${err}`);
    throw err;
  }
};

const deleteMsg = async (receiptHandle: string, topicArn: string) => {
  const command = new DeleteMessageCommand({
    ReceiptHandle: receiptHandle,
    TopicArn: topicArn,
  });

  try {
    await snsClient.send(command);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error deleting message", err);
  }
};
```

The `CustomNotifications` CDK construct can then be added to the `backend` of the Amplify stack one or more times, with different props for each instance.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { CustomNotifications } from './custom/CustomNotifications/resource';
import { data } from './data/resource';

const backend = new defineBackend({
  data,
});

new CustomNotifications(
  backend.getStack("CustomNotifications"),
  "CustomNotifications",
  { sourceAddress: "sender@example.com", }
);
```

<Callout>
**Note:** Resources created by the `define*` helpers can only be accessed _after_ setting them on the `backend`.
</Callout>

## Defining a CDK Stack

<Callout>
The unit of deployment in the AWS CDK is called a stack. All AWS resources defined within the scope of a stack, either directly or indirectly, are provisioned as a single unit. [Read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/stacks.html)
</Callout>


The stack below contains a Lambda function that is deployed to a VPC. It is important that these resources be deployed as a single unit instead of composed from other constructs as their functionality depends on one another.

```ts title="amplify/custom/LambdaInAVpcStack/resource.ts"
import {
  CfnOutput,
  Duration,
  Stack,
  StackProps,
  aws_ec2 as ec2,
  aws_lambda as lambda,
} from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { NodejsFunction } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs";
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { dirname, join } from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);

export class LambdaInAVpcStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, "LambdaVpc", {
      subnetConfiguration: [
        {
          name: "Isolated",
          subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_ISOLATED,
        },
        {
          name: "Private",
          subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS,
        },
        {
          name: "Public",
          subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,
        },
      ],
    });

    // Create a security group to be used on the lambda functions
    const lambdaSecurityGroup = new ec2.SecurityGroup(
      this,
      "Lambda Security Group",
      {
        vpc,
      }
    );

    const getDataLambda: NodejsFunction = new NodejsFunction(
      this,
      `${id}-getDataLambda`,
      {
        memorySize: 1024,
        timeout: Duration.seconds(5),
        runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
        handler: "handler",
        entry: join(__dirname, "getData.ts"),
        vpc: vpc,
        vpcSubnets: { subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_ISOLATED },
        securityGroups: [lambdaSecurityGroup],
      }
    );

    new CfnOutput(this, `${id}-getDataLambdaArn`, {
      value: getDataLambda.functionArn,
      exportName: `${id}-getDataLambdaArn`,
    });
  }
}
```

The Lambda function code for the `getDataLambda` is:

```ts title="amplify/custom/LambdaInAVpcStack/getData.ts"
import type { APIGatewayProxyResultV2 } from "aws-lambda";

// example data; example data can be fetched from a database
const geoData = [
  {
    name: "United States",
    states: [
      "Alabama",
      "Alaska",
      "Arizona",
      //...
    ],
  },
];

export const handler = async (): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResultV2> => {
  try {
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify(geoData, null, 2),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Unable to connect to the database:", error);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify(error),
    };
  }
}
```

The `LambdaInAVpcStack` CDK stack can then be added to the `backend` of the Amplify stack one or more times, with different props for each instance.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { CustomNotifications } from './custom/CustomNotifications/resource';
import { data } from './data/resource';

const backend = new defineBackend({
  data,
});

new CustomNotifications(
  backend.getStack("CustomNotifications"),
  "CustomNotifications",
  { sourceAddress: "sender@example.com", }
);
```

## Community CDK Resources

The [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/) is a community-driven catalog of reusable infrastructure components. It is a place for developers to discover and share reusable patterns for AWS CDK, maintained by AWS.

In addition, the [Example projects using the AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples) repository contains a number of examples of reusable CDK constructs.

These resources can be leveraged to create custom CDK constructs that can be used in your Amplify project.
